financial rag model used for prediction of stocks
Financial Recommendation System using RAG and CTA Strategy Backtesting

This project implements a financial recommendation system using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for the financial domain. The application is designed to provide real-time financial recommendations and includes a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) strategy backtesting module to validate trading strategies.

Features

	•	RAG-based Recommendations: Utilizes a pre-trained RAG model from HuggingFace to generate financial recommendations.
	•	Data Retrieval: Retrieves and preprocesses stock data for strategy testing.
	•	CTA Strategy Backtesting: Implements a simple moving average crossover strategy using the Backtrader framework.
	•	API Endpoints: Includes a RESTful API for querying recommendations and triggering backtests.
